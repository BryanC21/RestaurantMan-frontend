RestaurantMan Frontend React Website 
=========================

<h2>Backend code: https://github.com/BryanC21/RestaurantMan-backend</h2>

My contributions: I was in charge of making the backend api. I designed a mySQL database to hold all app data, with AWS S3 for image hosting. I created a node.js api server using express.js. I also handled user authentication and authorization through JWT tokens. Set up AWS environment for these services: S3, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFront, AWS RDS, R53, IAM, CloudFormation, CodeStar.
